# 🎯 Tic-Tac-Toe AI

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an AI agent that plays the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game against a human player. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal decisions, ensuring that it never loses.

This project demonstrates concepts from game theory and search algorithms.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

### Minimax Algorithm

Minimax is a recursive decision-making algorithm used in game theory.  
It simulates all possible future moves and selects the move that maximizes the AI’s chance of winning while minimizing the opponent’s chance.

### Why AI is Unbeatable

Because Minimax explores the full game tree and always selects the optimal move, the AI will:
- Win whenever possible
- Force a draw if winning is not possible
- Never lose
