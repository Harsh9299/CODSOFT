Recommendation System
Project Description
This project is a basic Recommendation System developed as part of my academic assignment. The main objective of this project is to suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences 
and similarities in data.
Recommendation systems are widely used in platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify to improve user experience by showing personalized suggestions. Through this project, I tried to understand
how such systems work behind the scenes.
Method Used:
In this project, I implemented a Content-Based Filtering approach.
The system uses:
Data preprocessing with Pandas and NumPy.
Feature extraction.
Cosine Similarity to measure similarity between items.
Based on the similarity scores, the system recommends the top matching items to the user.
Libraries:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
