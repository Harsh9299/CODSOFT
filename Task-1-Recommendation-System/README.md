# 🎯 Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Content-Based Recommendation System developed using Python. The system suggests relevant items to users based on similarity between item features. It demonstrates how platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify provide personalized recommendations.

The model analyzes item attributes, computes similarity scores, and returns the most relevant matches.
